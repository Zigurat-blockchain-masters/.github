### Zigurat Blockchain Study Group: Modules 8 and 9 🌐⛓️

<br>
Welcome to the official GitHub organization for the Modules 8 and 9 study group of the Global Master's in Blockchain Technologies at Zigurat! 🎓🎉

We are a dedicated, resourceful group of learners exploring the technical aspects of blockchain implementation. This organization serves as a hub for all our public repositories throughout our learning journey, providing a hands-on experience with real-world blockchain applications. 🚀

<br>

### What We Do 🛠

Through this GitHub organization, we manage, share, and track our progress in learning and implementing various blockchain technologies. Our repositories are divided into two primary areas of focus:

<br>

**Module 8:** Dedicated to coding a blockchain including 

- Network layer _(peer-to-peer, nodes)_
- Transaction layer
- Blockchain layer _(blocks management, mempool)_
- Trust layer  _(consensus algorithm)_
- Application layer


**Module 9:** Dedicated to Smart contracts development using Solidity

<br>
These repositories contain comprehensive code, learning resources, project documentation, and other useful materials for each module. Each repository serves as a mini knowledge-base, facilitating peer learning and collaboration.



### Projects & Kanban Boards 📋

Every repository here has a corresponding project which we manage using a Kanban board. We use this method to track our progress, manage tasks, and maintain a smooth workflow. We find it a great way to visualize our work process and it helps us stay organized and focused. 🎯
